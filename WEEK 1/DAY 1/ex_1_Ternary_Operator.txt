\f0\fs24 \cf0 The code in \'91Ternary Operator\'92 creates a currentYear variable with the value 2012.\
\
It then asks the user in which year they were born, and assigns their input in response to the birthYear variable.\
\
It then approximates their age by subtracting birthYear from currentYear and assigns this value to the variable ageAprox.\
\
The Ternary operator is then used to assign a blank string to the variable result if the age approximation is over 17, and the string \'93not \'93 to the variable result if the approximation is not over 17.\
\
The variable result is then inserted into printed string to output a true (as of 2012!) sentence regarding the user\'92s age.}
